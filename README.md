# php-mini-mvc-framework
# PHP Mini MVC Framework is a simple and extensible PHP mini-framework created while learning backend concepts. It includes routing, middleware, controllers, views, helpers, and session handling. Perfect for understanding how frameworks like Laravel work internally.


A lightweight PHP mini-framework built from scratch using pure OOP concepts.

Features:
✔ Custom router (GET/POST)
✔ Middleware system (Auth / Guest)
✔ Session handling
✔ Controller + View structure
✔ URL, redirect, view, asset helpers
✔ BASE_URL support for Apache & PHP built-in server
✔ Clean folder architecture
✔ Ready for deployment (Hostinger / Apache)

This project is built for learning core backend concepts, not as a production framework.
